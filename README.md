AdaptiveTuner
=============

Adaptronic Select ECU Tuning Aid for Android.

Adaptive Tuner displays key gauge data: RPM, MAP, MAT, WAT, and AFR.  It 
additionally presents the status of the 6 Adaptive Mode Learning State 
flags using a big visual graphic for each, alleviating the need to wire 
up LEDs if you use Adaptive Closed Loop for learning.
